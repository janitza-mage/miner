Framebuffers:
There are two classes of framebuffers: a window system-provided framebuffer
associated with a context when the context is made current, and application-created
framebuffers. The window system-provided framebuffer is referred to as the de-
fault framebuffer. Application-created framebuffers, referred to as framebuffer ob-
jects, may be created as desired, A context may be associated with two frame-
buffers, one for each of reading and drawing operations. The default framebuffer
and framebuffer objects are distinguished primarily by the interfaces for configur-
ing and managing their state.



"GL commands performing rendering into a framebuffer are sometimes treated specially by other GL operations such as
conditional rendering (see section 10.9). Such commands are called rendering commands, and include":
• glBlitFramebuffer (see section 18.3.2)
• glClear (see section 17.4.3)
• glClearBuffer* (see section 17.4.3.1)
• glDispatchCompute* (see section 19)



Renderbuffer: single image. Color Buffer ist ein RB; Depth Buffer ist ein anderer RB.

Framebuffer: Mehrere Renderbuffers; ein Color Buffer, ein Depth Buffer, ein Stencil Buffer. RB ist "attached" an FB.
